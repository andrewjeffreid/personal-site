            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a baseball player at New York University. I study Finance at Stern, and I’m also pursuing a minor in Computer Science. </p>
            <p>For me, Texas is home. I was born and raised in Sugar Land, TX but moved to New York City to be surrounded by the best talent. Living in NYC, I connect with many awesome creators and personalities. Several have become my closest friends.</p>
            <p>Much of my recent interest has involved discrete mathematics, and I'm living in Florida this summer to work in private equity. I write down some of my thoughts and experiences <a class="bodylink" href="writing.html">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>I currently work as a Summer Analyst at <a href="https://www.southwakecapital.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">South Wake Capital</a>. So far, I've learned about Merger and LBO modeling, Corporate Valuation, and Financial Statement Analysis.</p>
            <p>In 2021, I held a business development role at <a href="https://andor.ai/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Andor</a>: a venture studio that builds companies using a unique incubation model to create, and sometimes fail, at lightning pace. At Andor, I was constantly creating, and it's also how I got into coding. I'm still great friends with the founder.</p>
            <p>Though I don't get paid for it, I really enjoy teaching. I normally tutor friends at NYU in subjects ranging from Calculus to Financial Accounting to Computer Science. I do this frequently, and it helps me really master a subject.</p>

        <div class="item3">
            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>I'm proficient in Java, Python, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I genuinely enjoy programming. I'll pick up a project from time to time, but I write most of my code in the classroom nowadays.</p>
            <p>I built a few <a href='https://github.com/andrewjeffreid/deep-learning-projects' target='_blank'class="bodylink">deep learning projects</a> with TensorFlow/Keras. Their purposes include classifying x-ray images of lungs as healthy or having pneumonia, classifying forest cover types, and determining the likelihood a student would be admitted to college.</p>
            <p>I created a <a href='https://github.com/andrewjeffreid/point-and-figure-charting' target="_blank" class="bodylink">point and figure charting tool</a> to generate the chart for any publicly traded company over its past year, using a 3-box reversal method to filter out market noise. I also built a <a href='https://github.com/andrewjeffreid/Blackjack' target="_blank" class="bodylink">blackjack game</a>.</p>
            <h2>Personal</h2>
            <p>I love playing baseball and everything it entails: from the eight hour practices to the team dinners and roadtrips. Naturally, it's what I put most of my time into.</p>
            <p>Aside from baseball, I watch a lot of movies. Some of my favorites are Bronx Tale, Hell or High Water, and Whiplash, but I have a complete list on my <a class="bodylink" href="https://letterboxd.com/andrewjeffreid/" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a>. I'm always open to suggestions.</p>
            <p>I think there's an incredible amount of value in creating things, whether it be physical items, content, or ideas. It's something I'm constantly working on.</p>
