        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>03/30/2022</p>
        <p>I decided to make a blog, so I figured I’d introduce myself first—my name’s Andrew. I’m originally from Texas, but I currently live in NYC and attend New York University (where I play baseball and study business). I hope you get to learn more about me as you read my content.</p>
        <h2>Why I'm writing</h2>
        <p>I created this blog to have a place where I’d rather be original than right. I want to document and share some of my thoughts and experiences. For the past few years, I really haven’t been writing that much. I never thought I’d miss writing school essays or even be interested in keeping a journal, but I think there is so much value in creating things other people can see.</p>
        <p>I’ve been going back and forth on creating this for a while now, and I had doubt for a few reasons:</p>
        <ul class="bloglist">
            <li>I was worried that I’d never be writing my real opinions down if I knew someone was reading them, so my content wouldn’t be as genuine.</li>
            <li>Between baseball, school, and work, I don’t have the time.</li>
            <li>I was afraid that putting my thoughts into some centralized format wouldn’t leave me much of a story left to tell in person.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recently, I was re-inspired by a couple of friends to create this. I think the key is it has to be something I enjoy, and I’ll only get better and figure things out by doing it.</p>
        <h2>Looking forward</h2>
        <p>I’m gonna shoot from the hip. The editing is going to be light, and you’ll probably find some errors. As far as topics I want to explore, I see myself talking about baseball, academia, finance, and programming, as well as just describing some of the experiences I have. But honestly, I don't really have a clear direction for where this is going yet. We'll see what happens.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
