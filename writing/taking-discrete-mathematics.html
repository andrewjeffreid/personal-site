        <h1>Taking Discrete Mathematics</h1>
        <p>03/07/2022</p>
        <h2>Why I’m in this course</h2>
        <p>Originally, I was planning on double majoring in Finance and Computer Science at NYU. I love programming, but I realized it was something I could teach myself much faster than Finance. I’m also not interested in pursuing a career in Software Engineering. I would much rather be on the business side of things but have a dangerous amount of technical knowledge; it’s more fun that way. Anyways, I ended up switching Computer Science to my minor this semester. Unfortunately, prior to this decision, I decided to take Discrete Mathematics (a very intense course for the Computer Science major) this semester and am now stuck in it. Essentially, I’m in a weed-out class for a major I’m no longer pursuing.</p>
        <p>Discrete Mathematics has nothing to do with Computer Science. If it did, I would be much more interested in taking it. Instead, it’s just hard and takes up almost all of my time aside from baseball. There’s no glory in it at all, it’s just something that has to be done. I could go on and on complaining about the class and even college in general, but enough griping.</p>
        <h2>How I rationalize it</h2>
        <p>I decided to go at it at max intensity. For 2 hours every Tuesday and Thursday morning, I put my head down and grind. At this point, it’s almost a game to me: what is the highest level of seriousness I can take Discrete Math with? I’m already stuck so what good does it do if I waste my time even more and put in the bare minimum to pass. So, I’ve been going full steam ahead with it, and I’m going to get an A, even if the benefit to me is still unclear.</p>
        <p>The professor is great. He’s an excellent teacher and fair, but definitely not “chill”. It’s exactly what I need to stay disciplined. I’ve also met some really awesome classmates along the way that have made the class enjoyable. It’s important to stay grounded and not get too lost in my seriousness.</p>
        <p>Don’t get me wrong, I still can’t wait to finish this class. Today, I took my second exam (out of three) and did well. Discrete Math marks a turning point for me. After this semester, I’m halfway done with college. From here on out, it’s heavy finance courses.</p>
